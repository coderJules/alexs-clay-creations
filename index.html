      <h2>Come see the animal kingdom through one artist's eyes, and learn about his incredible journey. <!-- Artist Alex Torres began sculpting little animals at a young age. Though his medium was simply silly putty and Playdough, Alex's artistic ability was evident. Eventually he switched from silly putty to polymer clay. These days he creates unique clay animals in his own trademark style. --></h2>

  <h1>About Alex</h1>
    <p> At the age of two years, seven months, Alex was diagnosed with autism. Along with his diagnosis came many challenges.  but one thing always came easy for Alex was art. When busy working with his hands Alex finds enjoyment and relief from his anxiety.

    Over the years, he has refined his talent, and
    developed his own signature style. Once you
    have seen Alex's work, it is easy to recognize
    the whimsical personality of one of his pieces.</p>
